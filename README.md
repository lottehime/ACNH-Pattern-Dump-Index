<!-- ABOUT -->
## About ACNH Pattern Dump Index:

If you're like most Animal Crossing New Horizons players, you love messing about making your cool island theme and plastering custom design patterns all over the place. Me too. üìêüñåÔ∏è

Getting back into ACNH this year and wanting to do some modding of my save file, it was annoying to find design patterns online that were easily accessible without having to click through unnecessarily fluffy UIs to download a few files. Then those files were all in slightly different formats (untrimmed bin, trimmed bin, QR only, scrambled bin, code only, etc.) and it drove me nuts as a user! ü§¨

So I did a little reversing of some apps and sites and decided to dump a bunch of patterns I could find and store for myself.  
The only problem? Browsing and maintaining that catalog! üò´  
I then set out to create a single script that builds a simple site that can catalog and present those patterns with their available details and allow them to be searched/filtered and downloaded as untrimmed [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE) compatible files. ‚úå

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features:

### Generic:
* Use the pages buttons or dropdown to navigate further.  
* Use the filter fields to search by name of creator, name of pattern, tags, and by pattern type.  
* Hover over an image to enlarge and view it in a larger size (for seeing pattern details or for scanning a QR).  
* Click the download links to get the files.

### Normal Pattern Dump
The directory ``files/pat`` contains a living dump of normal pattern files in ``.nhd`` format along with a ``.png`` of the pattern a ``.txt`` with its details, a ``.QR.png`` QR Code for the pattern (or a placeholder) and a ``.acnl`` file for any interoperable patterns.  
They're browsable from your OS on their own (obviously) due to this.  
Simply download the ``.nhd`` by clicking the download link, then load into your save with NHSE - or if you're running OFW you can scan the QR into NookLink for those that are supported.

### PRO Pattern Dump
The directory ``files/pro`` contains a living dump of normal pattern files in ``.nhpd`` format along with a ``.png`` of the pattern a ``.txt`` with its details, a ``.QR.png`` QR Code for the pattern (or a placeholder) and a ``.acnl`` file for any interoperable patterns. 
They're browsable from your OS on their own (obviously) due to this.  
Simply download the ``.nhpd`` by clicking the download link, then load into your save with NHSE - or if you're running OFW you can scan the QR into NookLink for those that are supported.

### Website
It's made up of 3 parts: ``files/table.html`` (generated), ``files/top.html`` (static) and ``files/bot.html`` (static) that are combined into a single ``index.html``.
Load up the index and browse away.
It's also available online here: [ACNH Pattern Dump Index (GitHub Pages)](https://lottehime.github.io/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index/)

### Windows Batch File Page Creator/Updater
The batch file ``live_makehtml.bat`` can be run to generate a new version of the index and pattern pages.  
Consider that it will take time! Especially on a slow drive, or a network drive. It's gathering up <strong>a lot</strong> of files into the ``table.html`` file!

### Source
To build your own customised version, refer to the ``_src`` folder.  
Place your normal patterns in ``_src/files/pat`` and your PRO patterns in ``_src/files/pro``.  
Then run ``_src/makehtml.bat`` as is, or modified to your liking.

The file formats are as follows:

<strong>Normal Design Pattern Files:</strong>  
Each design patterns 4 files need to have the same name (minus extensions).
* ``.nhd``: Normal Design Pattern Data, ``0x2A8`` (680 bytes) in size. Untrimmed. NHSE compatible.
* ``.png``: 32x32px PNG of the pattern, transparency included. Preference is a 1:1 data to PNG encode, limit post-processing.
* ``.QR.png``: QR Code PNG of the for the pattern, or a placeholder "no qr" image. 
* ``.txt``: 4 line file.
  * Line 1: design pattern type.
  * Line 2: design pattern name.
  * Line 3: creator name.
  * Line 4: tags separated by commas.
Optionally, for ACNL interoperable pattern types a ``.acnl`` file with the same name can be included as well.

<strong>PRO Design Pattern Files:</strong>  
Each design patterns 4 files need to have the same name (minus extensions).
* ``.nhpd``: PRO Design Pattern Data, ``0x8A8`` (2216 bytes) in size. Untrimmed. NHSE compatible.
* ``.png``: 64x64px PNG of the pattern, transparency included. Preference is a 1:1 data to PNG encode, limit post-processing.
* ``.QR.png``: QR Code PNG of the for the pattern, or a placeholder "no qr" image. 
* ``.txt``: 4 line file.
  * Line 1: design pattern type.
  * Line 2: design pattern name.
  * Line 3: creator name.
  * Line 4: tags separated by commas.
  Optionally, for ACNL interoperable pattern types a ``.acnl`` file with the same name can be included as well.

### Tools
WIP. See roadmap below.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Host on GitHub Pages.
- [X] Integrate QR codes into the website script side (probably QR as ``.png``, show QR.png either below pattern image or as mouseover).
- [X] Cleanup the batch file and combine some iterating for efficieny of file size and build time.
- [X] Better, faster, responsive site to replace the basic one.
- [ ] (WIP) Add tool for creating needed image and text files from ``.nhd`` and ``.nhpd`` files.
- [ ] (WIP) Add tool for producing QR codes from the files (needs some reversing).


See the [open issues](https://github.com/lottehime/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index/issues) for any additional community proposed features (and known issues).

## Installation

_For local use as is hosted here with the current dump:_

1. Download a zip of the repo and unpack it; <strong>or</strong>
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lottehime/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index.git
   ```
3. Simply open ``index.html`` and away you go.

_To build your own:_

1. Download a zip of the repo and unpack it; <strong>or</strong>
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lottehime/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index.git
   ```
3. Either move or copy the ``_src`` folder to where you intend to run it and modify the contents of ``_src/files/pat`` and ``_src/files/pro``; <strong>or</strong>
4. Modify the contents of ``files/pat`` and ``files/pro`` in the root directory (those containing the current dump).
5. Then run ``_src/makehtml.bat`` if modifying from the ``_src`` folder, or ``live_makehtml.bat`` if operating in the root.
6. Wait for it to build the ``index.html`` file.
7. Host as desired.

If you would like to submit patterns to the dumps, please do so via a pull request and place them in the ``queue`` folders ``pat`` or ``pro`` subfolder.  
They should be in the form of ``.nhd`` or ``.nhpd`` and have a ``.png`` and ``.txt`` file included that follows the format laid out in the above sections as well as their QR Code (or placeholder) ``.png``. The file names should be identical (except for the extensions, obviously).  
I am also happy to receive them via the issue tracker.

I will periodically moderate them and run an update to the site here. <strong>Please don't submit dumb offensive stuff, OK? Behave yourself.</strong>
