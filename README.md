<!-- ABOUT -->
## About ACNH Pattern Dump Index:

If you're like most Animal Crossing New Horizons players, you love messing about making your cool island theme and plastering custom design patterns all over the place. Me too. üìêüñåÔ∏è

Getting back into ACNH this year and wanting to do some modding of my save file, it was annoying to find design patterns online that were easily accessible without having to click through unnecessarily fluffy UIs to download a few files. Then those files were all in slightly different formats (untrimmed bin, trimmed bin, QR only, scrambled bin, code only, etc.). No shade on the dev work, but it drove me nuts as a user! ü§¨

So I did a little reversing of some apps and sites and decided to dump a bunch of patterns I could find and store for myself.  
The only problem? Browsing and maintaining that catalog! üò´  
I then set out to create a single script that builds a 3 page simple site (nojQuery, no DBs, no dependencies, etc.) that can catalog and present those patterns with their available details and allow them to be downloaded as untrimmed [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE) compatible files. ‚úå

Is it the most elegant thing ever? ‚ùå  
Is it the most efficient site ever? ‚ùå  
Does it do it's job? ‚úîÔ∏è  
Is it available to everyone to edit and easily contributed to? ‚úîÔ∏è

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features:

### Normal Pattern Dump
The directory ``pat`` contains a living dump of normal pattern files in ``.nhd`` format along with a ``.png`` of the pattern and a ``.txt`` with it's details.  
They're browsable from your OS on their own (obviously) due to this.

### PRO Pattern Dump
The directory ``pro`` contains a living dump of normal pattern files in ``.nhpd`` format along with a ``.png`` of the pattern and a ``.txt`` with it's details.  
They're browsable from your OS on their own (obviously) due to this.

### Website
It's made up of 3 parts: ``index.html``, ``pattern.html`` and ``pro.html``.  
Load up the index and browse away.
It's also available online here: LINK_INCOMING_SOON

Use the Villger faces as a button to go back to index from the other pages.  
Pagination is done through hiding divs, so each load of the ``pattern.html`` and ``pro.html`` pages causes the load animation while it loads up the thousands of patterns. It's a little slow because it's a janky way to do it, but it means no DBs etc.

### Windows Batch File Page Creator/Updater
The batch file ``live_makehtml.bat`` can be run to generate a new version of the index and pattern pages.  
Consider that it will take time! Especially on a slow drive, or a network drive. It's gathering up <strong>a lot</strong> of files!

### Source
To build your own customised version, refer to the ``_src`` folder.  
Place your normal patterns in ``_src/pat`` and your PRO patterns in ``_src/pro``.  
Then run ``makehtml.bat`` as is, or modified to your liking.

### Tools
WIP. See roadmap below.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Add tool for creating needed image and text files from ``.nhd`` and ``.nhpd`` files.
- [ ] Add tool for producing QR codes from the files (needs some reversing).
- [ ] Integrate QR codes into the website script side (probably QR as ``.png``, show QR.png either below pattern image or as mouseover).
- [ ] Cleanup the batch file and combine some iterating for efficieny of file size and build time.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lottehime/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index/issues) for any additional community proposed features (and known issues).

## Installation

_For local use as is hosted here with the current dump:_

1. Download a zip of the repo and unpack it; <strong>or</strong>
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lottehime/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index.git
   ```
3. Simply open ``index.html`` and away you go.

_To build your own:_

1. Download a zip of the repo and unpack it; <strong>or</strong>
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lottehime/ACNH-Pattern-Dump-Index.git
   ```
3. Either move or copy the ``_src`` folder to where you intend to run it and modify the contents of ``_src/pat`` and ``_src/pro``; <strong>or</strong>
4. Modify the contents of ``pat`` and ``pro`` in the root directory (those containing the current dump).
5. Then run ``_src/makehtml.bat`` if modifying from the ``_src`` folder, or ``live_makehtml.bat`` if operating in the root.
6. Wait for it to build the ``.html`` files.
7. Host as desired.
